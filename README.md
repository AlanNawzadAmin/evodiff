### Installation
```
cd dms
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate dms
pip install -e .
```
We obtain sequences from the [Uniref50 dataset](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4375400/), which contains approximately 45 million protein sequences. The Multiple Sequence Alignments (MSAs) are from the [OpenFold dataset](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.11.20.517210v2), containing MSAs for 132,000 unique Protein Data Bank (PDB) chains.

### Loading pretrained models
To load a model:
```
from dms.pretrained import OA_AR_640M

model, collater, tokenizer, scheme = OA_AR_640M()
```
Available models are:
* ``` D3PM_BLOSUM_640M() ```
* ``` D3PM_BLOSUM_38M() ```
* ``` D3PM_UNIFORM_640M() ```
* ``` D3PM_UNIFORM_38M() ```
* ``` OA_AR_640M() ```
* ``` OA_AR_38M() ```
* ``` LR_AR_640M() ```
* ``` LR_AR_38M() ```
* ``` CARP_38M() ```
* ``` CARP_640M() ```
* ``` ESM1b_640M() ```

### Unconditional sequence generation
For sequence generation run:
``` python generate.py --model-type oa_ar_640m --final_norm --num-seqs 250 ```

For MSA generation run:
``` python generate-msa.py TODO: ADD MODEL TYPE --subsampling random --batch-size 1 ```

### Conditional sequence generation from MSA
There are two ways to conditionally generate an MSA. 

The first is to generate the alignment from the query. To do so run:

``` python generate-msa.py TODO: ADD MODEL TYPE --subsampling random --batch-size 1 --start-query ```

The second is to generate the query from the alignment. To do so run:

``` python generate-msa.py TODO: ADD MODEL TYPE --subsampling random --batch-size 1 --start-msa ```

Note that you can only start-query or start-msa, not both. To generate unconditionally, omit the flags (see example in above section).

### Analysis of generations
To access the test sequences:
```
test_data = UniRefDataset('data/uniref50/', 'rtest', structure=False)
```
To access the generated sequences: 
```
TODO
```
To analyze the quality of the generations, we look at the amino acid KL divergence ([aa_reconstruction_parity_plot](https://github.com/microsoft/DMs/blob/main/analysis/plot.py), the secondary structre KL divergence ([DMs/analysis/calc_kl_ss.py](https://github.com/microsoft/DMs/blob/main/analysis/calc_kl_ss.py)), the Fr√©chet inception distance ([DMs/analysis/calc_fid.py](https://github.com/microsoft/DMs/blob/main/analysis/calc_fid.py)), and the hamming distance ([DMs/analysis/calc_nearestseq_hamming.py](https://github.com/microsoft/DMs/blob/main/analysis/calc_nearestseq_hamming.py)).

We also compute the self-consistency perplexity to evaluate the foldability of generated sequences (TODO: file).

TODO: FIX CODE ABOVE + check file paths for analysis functions! @sarah
